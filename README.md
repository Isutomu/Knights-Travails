This is a first for me, but since this was the first project that really threw me for a loop (had to even look up a little on the Discord) I thought about writing about it for a bit.

To be honest, the main problem is that the other projects leading up to this one were too conceptual, so when it came to apply the logics to a real problem I was at a loss. That being said, more technical parts of learning tend to be this way, so I guess it's just an "unlucky" situation. (or brain dif on my part, but let me cope)

I ended up making this by applying the "abstract data type" concept, changing a little on how the Khan Academy "Representing Graphs" section shows a graph with the adjacency lists. Nothing too big, just turned an array into a dictionary.
Same thing goes about applying Breath-first search to the adjacency(dict) lists.

Although not being anything revolutionary it was fun to apply the technical concepts in a lil bit different way than the textbook and see it working.(Hence why I felt compelled to yap about it)
